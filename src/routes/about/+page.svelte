		<br style="margin-bottom: 12px;" />
		<span class="text-red-500 font-bold text-xl">
			You get currency from working on your hardware projects, once you ship them to the
			marketplace! <br />
			Once your project is approved, you will receive 5 coins per hour spent working on the project.
			<br />
			When someone buys your project, and you ship it out, you will receive the coins from that sale.
